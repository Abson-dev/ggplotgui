## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.4.0
* Ubuntu precise (on travis-ci), R 3.4.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There was 1 NOTE (only in the 'win-builder'):

* Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Ggplots (2:15)
  ggplots (5:46)

  Ggplots is used in title, but ggplot seems more reasonable in description.

This is my first submission.
